## BACKGROUND

When we need to insert some variables, we generally consider inserting the variables into HTML through the `script` tag instead of inserting them directly into JS files, so that different variables can be obtained according to different HTML entries.

This plugin is a convenient plugin based on `html-webpack-plugin`, so be sure to pass in the class and instance of `html-webpack-plugin`. The plugin will only use the version of the '`html-webpack-plugin`' you use.

**The plugin itself is generally only used as the basic capability of other upper-level plug-ins in this project.**
