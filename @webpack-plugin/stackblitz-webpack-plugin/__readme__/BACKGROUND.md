## BACKGROUND

The node project is difficult to use Stackblitz to create online demo (Requires an open source platform or project). And in some Monorepo project, some private libraries are not release to NPM, so it difficult to create demo with Stackblitz. This plug-in mainly helps users write Stackblitz demo locally or online.
