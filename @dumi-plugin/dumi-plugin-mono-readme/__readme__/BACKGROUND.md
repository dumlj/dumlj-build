## BACKGROUND

In the monorepo project, the projects have certain standard, and there are a lot of repeated descriptions in the README.md, such as dependency installation, writing project titles and descriptions, etc.
Therefore, we can render the README.md dynamically, thereby reducing document writing and finally pushed to Dumi.
